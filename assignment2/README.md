# Midterm 2

Midterm 2 consisted in the development from a scratch of a Bayesian Network based on a factual story. 
The different probabilities for the Conditional Probability Tables were chosen based on common sense.
In the end, _ancestral sampling_ was used to draw samples from this Bayesian Network based on the probabilities and the previous samples.
